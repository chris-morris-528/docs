 People are a list of user accounts typically representative of the members of your organization in-scope for audit. Vanta has powerful onboarding and offboarding workflows that can be leveraged within the application, as well as other capabilities that involve the management of these user resources. In this section, you'll learn about a few of the workflows supported by the API, such as how to:

* Query a list of recurring security tasks assigned to your People and their statuses
* Complete the offboarding process for your People
* Programmatically mark service accounts as "Not a Person" to remove those accounts from recurring security tasks
